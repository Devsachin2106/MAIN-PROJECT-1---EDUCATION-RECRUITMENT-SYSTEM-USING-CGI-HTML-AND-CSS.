<h2>1.Python Lists:</h2>
         <h3> * List:</h3>
            <h4> *  Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<h4>

            <h4> *  Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</h4>

            <h4> *  Lists are created using square brackets[]</h4>

<h2>2.List Items:</h2>
          <h4> List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.</h4>

          <h4>List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</h4>

<h2>3.Ordered:</h2>
         <h4> When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</h4>

         <h4>If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.</h4>

<h2>4.Changeable:</h2>
         <h4>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</h4>

<h2>5.Allow Duplicates:</h2>
         <h4>Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:</h4>
<h2>6.Python Tuples:</h2>
           <h3>*Tuple:</h3>
                   <h4> Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</h4>

                   <h4> Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</h4>

                   <h4> A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.</h4>

                   <h4> Tuples are written with round brackets.</h4>
<h2>7.Set:</h2>
    <h4> Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<h4>

    <h4>Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</h4>

    <h4>A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.</h4>

<h2>8.Dictionary:</h2>
          <h4>Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.</h4>

          <h4>A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.</h4>

          <h4>As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.</h4>

          <h4>Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:</h4>

<h2>9.Python Conditions and If statements:</h2>
            
         <h3>* Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</h3>

           <h4> * Equals: a == b</h4>
           <h4> * Not Equals: a != b</h4>
           <h4> * Less than: a < b</h4>
           <h4> * Less than or equal to: a <= b</h4>
           <h4> * Greater than: a > b</h4>
           <h4> * Greater than or equal to: a >= b</h4>
           <h4> * These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</h4>

              <h4>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</h4>

<h2>10.Python Loops:</h2>
	<h3>* Python has two primitive loop commands:</h3>
       		<h4> * while loops</h4>
       		<h4> * for loops</h4>
<h2>11.The while Loop:</h2>
         <h4>* With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</h4>

<h2>12.Python For Loops</h2>
	<h4>* A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</h4>

	<h4>* This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</h4>

	<h4>* With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</h4>
